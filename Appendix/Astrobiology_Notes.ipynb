These civilizations also used the planets and stars to help them navigate. As civilization advanced, new technological advances allowed us to see and learn more about space. They allowed us to see a different view of the Moon (Luna 3). They also allowed us to find planets outside our own solar system (Kepler and T.E.S.S), and helped put to rest some theories about Earth itself (Earth's water didn't come from comets).\n",
